            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Betty Chen and I was born in Manhattan, NY, but only remember most of my childhood spent in
                Buffalo, NY. After a couple of years, my family moved to Ridgewood, NJ, where I stayed until I graduated
                from high school. I then graduated from UCONN with a bachelor's in Molecular and Cell Biology. After
                that, I worked in a pharmaceutical industry for one year and then a chemical laboratory for two years. I
                am now learning how to be a web developer through Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I enjoy eating all kinds of foods, such as Korean BBQ and sushi. watching shows, reading webtoons,
                playing games, baking, listening
                to music, and dancing.</p>

                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an
                internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives
                you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly

                Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search ranking and visibility
                for your business.
