# **Portfolio**

## **Description**

Making my first professional portfolio.

**HTML, CSS, and Normalize CSS**

Used template from Code Refactoring Project to create the base of HTML and CSS. Found a template for normalized css online. Peformed code refactoring according to my needs and its functionality.

- **HTML** - Codes were changed/added to resemble a portfolio. Images with their alt tag were added for aesthetic and represent Works Applications. My name, placeholder image (to be updated in future), navigation bar with functioning links to "about me", "works", and "contact me" are presented.

- **CSS** - Selectors were modified accordingly to the HTML file. Advanced CSS, such as Media Query, Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements were used to style the website and make it responsive across all devices and browsers. Images enlarge and title displays when hovered over with mouse cursor. Link to deployed works application directs user to different tab. Media query has been added to present a responsive layout on various screens and devices.
